# Usage

## Running the nodes

See https://docs.corda.net/tutorial-cordapp.html#running-the-example-cordapp.

## Interacting with the nodes

### Shell

When started via the command line, each node will display an interactive shell:

    Welcome to the Corda interactive shell.
    Useful commands include 'help' to see what is available, and 'bye' to shut down the node.
    
    Tue Nov 06 11:58:13 GMT 2018>>>

You can use this shell to interact with your node. For example, enter `run networkMapSnapshot` to see a list of 
the other nodes on the network:

    Tue Nov 06 11:58:13 GMT 2018>>> run networkMapSnapshot
    [
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10002" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=Notary, L=London, C=GB" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505484825
    },
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10005" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=PartyA, L=London, C=GB" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505382560
    },
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10008" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=PartyB, L=New York, C=US" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505384742
    }
    ]

You can find out more about the node shell [here](https://docs.corda.net/shell.html).

### Client

`clients/src/main/kotlin/com/template/Client.kt` defines a simple command-line client that connects to a node via RPC 
and prints a list of the other nodes on the network.
